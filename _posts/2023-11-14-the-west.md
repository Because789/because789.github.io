Recently I found this random quote on twitter:

>The problem with the West is that it professes to be civilized (it is not; see, 'history') and it professes to have enlightened values of freedom, free speech, etc, but when pushed, when things get tough, all these things go out the window and we catch glimpse of the fascist underpinnings that are always there.
>
>The West doesn't actually stand for anything at all. It has no moral center, no true north, no religion outside of money to center its people...it has nothing to guide it outside the everchanging whims of the zeitgeist.
>
>The West stands behind nothing it espouses because it never meant any of it in the first place, which is why its so-called values cannot be relied upon during trying times. In the face of human tragedy of great scope, it's as if the West is seeing it for the first time, unable to glean wisdom from historical parallels. It doesn't see parallels because it cannot see past the centering of itself.
>
>The west is a hollow shell.\
It's dead.\
If it were ever truly alive.

Well well well, isn't that a thing of beauty.
